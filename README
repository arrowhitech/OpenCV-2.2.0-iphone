## Notes by Jimmy

Goal here is to have a project anybody can use easily to pull OpenCV into his
iOS project. It is not supported, but is based almost entirely off the fine
work here: http://computer-vision-talks.com/2010/12/building-opencv-for-ios/

Builds under SDK 4.2, the iOS build target is 4.0.

Does not include highgui or any of the included apps.

Did I mention it's not supported? :)
